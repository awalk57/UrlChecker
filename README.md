# UrlChecker
quick and easy program to check numerous URLS for uptime.This is definitely 
a work in progress and really is just a begginning shell.
Note project is dependent on the version of grequests.py updated by
Kenneth Reitz. I included it here to correct a pip install problem.
This is also my first project to use the Github so I am pushing frequently
to see how it all works.
